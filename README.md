# MyHealthBio
Hackathon project

As an active participant in a hackathon, I played a vital role in the development of an innovative IOS mobile application. By leveraging React Native as the frontend UI and Java as the backend, we created an integration of personal health and social media to promote community fitness and motivation. The app offers a wide range of features, including user profile creation, progress tracking, achievement sharing, and connection with like-minded individuals with similar health. I am proud to have contributed to a technology solution that promotes healthier living.
